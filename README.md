Develop a  website listing the menus of gourmet restaurants. In addition to traditional reservation systems, customers will be able to compose the menu for their meal, so that the dishes are ready when they arrive.

## Technologies

- html
- css
- sass

For developing this site, the images were modified to render a better esthetical view and a lighter site upon browsers.

I started to use and understand the use of sass which allowed me to structure more easily the code. Iv' learned also the use of SMACSS principles.

The site is responsive for several devices and the images are selected upon the device screen.
